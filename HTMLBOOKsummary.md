```
<html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>

 `en-us`is Attribute Value
 Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element and it consist of name and a value,.

 - HTML pages are text documents.
 - HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
 - Tags are often referred to as elements.
 - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
 - Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
 - Attributes require a name and a value.
 - To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

 - To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
