# comparison operators:
### evaluating conditions
the result will be a **boolean:true or false**
`==` this is equal to
`!=` is not equal to
`===` strict equal to 
`!==` strict not equal to
`>` greater than
`<` less then
`>=` greater than or equal to
`<=` less than or equal

# logical operators
## There are 3 logical operators 
### `&&` logical AND  `||` logical OR `!`logical NOT
### it consists of componant expressions such as `((9<2) && (1>=5))`
### the `(9<2)` expression number 1 means is nine less than two ? false
### the `(2>=3)` expression number 2 means is one grater or equal to five? false
### `&&` logical operator 
### the `((9<2) && (1>=5))` expression number 3 means do expression number 1 and expression number 2 both evaluate to true ? false


# Loops
### loops check a condtion . if it returns true. acode block will run . then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true . the code block will run again. it repets till the conditions returns false.
## types of loops three commen loops:
`For` A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
`while` A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
`do while` The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
### all these called key words
### the syntax 
```
for (var i = 0; i <15 ; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}
```
### for is a key word
### what is in `()` is conditions
### `document.write(i);` is code to be executed during the loops
### `var i=0` initialization
### ` i<15` condition
### ` i++` update
