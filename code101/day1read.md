What is Markdown ?
Markdown (Links to an external site.) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists 
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
Syntax guide
 use (**) before and after word  and using (#) for headers  and (*) or (-) for listing.
