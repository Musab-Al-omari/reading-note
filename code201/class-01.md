## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” 
    This is the  Typical formula for html code 

```
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
        <p>
        This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. 
        And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
        <p>
        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
         <p>
          Many long articles have sub-headings so to help 
          you follow the structure of what is being written. 
          There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).
         </p>

          <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 
         <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>  

    </body>
 
 </html>
```

what ever in `<>` its called tag 
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening such as  `<p>` and closing tags such as `</p>` .

### Attributes 

` <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p> ` 
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
lang is  Attribute name
en-us is atribute value 


## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup”
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last 
(with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).
### Escape Characters
Therefore, if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are
termed "escape" characters (also known as escape codes or entity references). For example,
to write a left angled bracket, you can use either `&lt;` or `&#60;`. For an ampersand < , you
can use either `&amp;`or `&#38;`.
### summary

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.


## HTML HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.



## HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design”

* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

## HTML The ABC of programing 
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
* Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
1. DEFINE THE GOAL
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3. CODE EACH STEP
### summary 

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
