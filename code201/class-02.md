* it divided for six tags based on the importance of the text `<h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6>`

### Paragraphs 

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>`    tag and closing `</p>` tag.

### Bold & Italic
By enclosing words in the tags `<b>` and `</b>` we can make characters appear bold.

By enclosing words in the tags `<i>` and `</i>` we can make characters appear italic.

### Superscript & Subscript
The `<sup>` element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.

The `<sub> `element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.
## summary
* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
