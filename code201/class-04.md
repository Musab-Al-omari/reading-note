## HTML Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” 
**Links** are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

**Links** are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The syntax `<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`
### Summary

* Links are created using the `<a>` element.
* The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## HTML Chapter 15: “Layout”
**Building Blocks**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

**Block-level** elements start on a new line Examples include: `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include: `<img> <b> <i>`
**Containing Elements**
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
