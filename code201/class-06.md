An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
The following example creates a new JavaScript object with four properties.

Example

it consist of  :-
1. object  ...... person
2. key .......... first name, last name ,age...etc.
3. value ........ what is comming after the key

### There is 2 ways to access to an object.

Dot natation like  `var hotelName = hotel.name;`
Square brackets    `var roomsFree = hotel [/'name/']`
