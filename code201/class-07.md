# Domain Modeling:

A domain model is a visual representation of conceptual classes or real-world objects in a domain of interest

Domain models are also called conceptual models, domain object models, and analysis object models.

UP defines a Domain Model as one of the artifacts that may be created in the Business Modeling discipline.

some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

Tables can be added to the web page by using table tag, elements tr of a tables create a row of the table, we don't of course forget about the cells which are the smallest element of the table, can be created using td tag and if it is a header using th tag, tables can be split into thead, tbody, and tfoot.

Functions are the amazing thing in JS we read about last week, which is represent a single task, taking parameters and may return a value.

Objects are combination of functions and variables that represent something from the environment, variables are known as properties and functions know as methods, other thing we discuss in the previous read assignment.
