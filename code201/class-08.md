## HTML Chapter 15: “Layout”
**Building Blocks**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

**Block-level** elements start on a new line Examples include: `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include: `<img> <b> <i>`
**Containing Elements**
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.



## Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
## Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
