# A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5
In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, that’s what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the First Great Browser Wars, Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData.

**userData** allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure. (Trusted domains, such as intranet sites, can store 10 times that amount. And hey, 640 KB ought to be enough for anybody.) IE does not present any form of permissions dialog, and there is no allowance for increasing the amount of storage available.

In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Within the Flash environment, the feature is properly known as Local Shared Objects. Briefly, it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain. Brad Neuberg developed an early prototype of a Flash-to-JavaScript bridge called AMASS (AJAX Massive Storage System), but it was limited by some of Flash’s design quirks. By 2006, with the advent of ExternalInterface in Flash 8, accessing LSOs from JavaScript became an order of magnitude easier and faster. Brad rewrote AMASS and integrated it into the popular Dojo Toolkit under the moniker dojox.storage. Flash gives each domain 100 KB of storage “for free.” Beyond that, it prompts the user for each order of magnitude increase in data storage (1 Mb, 10 Mb, and so on).

In 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers. (We’ve previously discussed Gears in the context of providing a geolocation API in Internet Explorer.) Gears provides an API to an embedded SQL database based on SQLite. After obtaining permission from the user once, Gears can store unlimited amounts of data per domain in SQL database tables.

In the meantime, Brad Neuberg and others continued to hack away on dojox.storage to provide a unified interface to all these different plugins and APIs. By 2009, dojox.storage could auto-detect (and provide a unified interface on top of) Adobe Flash, Gears, Adobe AIR, and an early prototype of HTML5 storage that was only implemented in older versions of Firefox.

As you survey these solutions, a pattern emerges: all of them are either specific to a single browser, or reliant on a third-party plugin. Despite heroic efforts to paper over the differences (in dojox.storage), they all expose radically different interfaces, have different storage limitations, and present different user experiences. So this is the problem that HTML5 set out to solve: to provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins.







# HTML5 STORAGE IN ACTION
Let’s see HTML5 Storage in action. Recall the Halma game we constructed in the canvas chapter. There’s a small problem with the game: if you close the browser window mid-game, you’ll lose your progress. But with HTML5 Storage, we can save the progress locally, within the browser itself. Here is a live demonstration. Make a few moves, then close the browser tab, then re-open it. If your browser supports HTML5 Storage, the demonstration page should magically remember your exact position within the game, including the number of moves you’ve made, the position of each of the pieces on the board, and even whether a particular piece is selected.

How does it work? Every time a change occurs within the game, we call this function:
```
function saveGameState() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] = gGameInProgress;
    for (var i = 0; i < kNumPieces; i++) {
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"] = gPieces[i].row;
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"] = gPieces[i].column;
    }
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"] = gSelectedPieceIndex;
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] = gSelectedPieceHasMoved;
    localStorage["halma.movecount"] = gMoveCount;
    return true;
}
```
As you can see, it uses the localStorage object to save whether there is a game in progress (gGameInProgress, a Boolean). If so, it iterates through the pieces (gPieces, a JavaScript Array) and saves the row and column number of each piece. Then it saves some additional game state, including which piece is selected (gSelectedPieceIndex, an integer), whether the piece is in the middle of a potentially long series of hops (gSelectedPieceHasMoved, a Boolean), and the total number of moves made so far (gMoveCount, an integer).

On page load, instead of automatically calling a newGame() function that would reset these variables to hard-coded values, we call a resumeGame() function instead. Using HTML5 Storage, the resumeGame() function checks whether a state about a game-in-progress is stored locally. If so, it restores those values using the localStorage object.
```
function resumeGame() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    gGameInProgress = (localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] == "true");
    if (!gGameInProgress) { return false; }
    gPieces = new Array(kNumPieces);
    for (var i = 0; i < kNumPieces; i++) {
	var row = parseInt(localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"]);
	var column = parseInt(localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"]);
	gPieces[i] = new Cell(row, column);
    }
    gNumPieces = kNumPieces;
    gSelectedPieceIndex = parseInt(localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"]);
    gSelectedPieceHasMoved = localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] == "true";
    gMoveCount = parseInt(localStorage["halma.movecount"]);
    drawBoard();
    return true;
}
```
The most important part of this function is the caveat that I mentioned earlier in this chapter, which I’ll repeat here: Data is stored as strings. If you are storing something other than a string, you’ll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it. For example, the flag for whether there is a game in progress (gGameInProgress) is a Boolean. In the saveGameState() function, we just stored it and didn’t worry about the datatype:

`localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] = gGameInProgress;`
But in the resumeGame() function, we need to treat the value we got from the local storage area as a string and manually construct the proper Boolean value ourselves:

`gGameInProgress = (localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] == "true");`
Similarly, the number of moves is stored in gMoveCount as an integer. In the saveGameState() function, we just stored it:

`localStorage["halma.movecount"] = gMoveCount;`
But in the resumeGame() function, we need to coerce the value to an integer, using the parseInt() function built into JavaScript:

`gMoveCount = parseInt(localStorage["halma.movecount"]);`
