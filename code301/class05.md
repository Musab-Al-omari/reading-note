### Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js
 **Node.js** is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications.



 ##### creating server by javascript  


 1. we need to create a JavaScript file. Let's name it server.js
 ```
var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.write("It's alive!");
  response.end();
}).listen(3000);
 ```
 2. Run at your terminal: ` node server.js `


 3. This is an example of how Node provides you with non-blocking and event-driven behavior. Let me explain:
 ```
$.post('/some_requested_resource', function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
 ```


 4. Make it worldwide using heroku 



 5. Create your project directory. And then create the server.js file inside of it.

First of all, let's declare some variables:
```
var http = require("http");
var fs = require("fs");
var path = require("path");
var mime = require("mime");
```
The first one will give you the key to Node's HTTP functionality. The second one is for possibility to interact with the file system. The third one allows you to handle file paths. The last one allows you to determine a file's MIME-type. And it's not a part of Node.js, so we need to install third-party dependencies before using it. We need to create the package.json file for that purpose. It will contain project related information, such as name, version, description, and so on. For our project we will use MIME-types recognition, because it's not enough to just send the contents of a file when you use HTTP. You also need to set the Content-Type header with proper MIME-type. That's why we need this plug-in


6. Create the package.json file and fill it with proper information. Here's mine:

```
{
  "name" : "blog",
  "version" : "0.0.1",
  "description" : "My minimalistic blog",
  "dependencies" : {
    "mime" : "~1.2.7"
  }
}
```
There are "name", "version", "description", and "dependencies" fields in it. The syntax is simple, as you can see. We added our "mime" plug-in and now it's time to download it. We'll use built-in Node Package Manager. Just run:` npm install `
It will create node_modules folder and place all the files inside of it. So, we resolve our dependencies and can return to our code.


7. We will now create send404() function. It will handle the sending of 404 error, which usually appears when requested file doesn't exist:

```
function send404(response) {
  response.writeHead(404, {"Content-type" : "text/plain"});
  response.write("Error 404: resource not found");
  response.end();
}
```
8. Nothing sophisticated with this one. It returns plain text when server can't find a page.
Now we will define sendPage() function. It first writes the header and then sends the contents of the file.
```
function sendPage(response, filePath, fileContents) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-type" : mime.lookup(path.basename(filePath))});
  response.end(fileContents);
}
```

Notice the way we handle the MIME-types.

Now we'll define how our server will handle responses. This function will return the content of the requested file or the 404 error otherwise:

```
function serverWorking(response, absPath) {
  fs.exists(absPath, function(exists) {
    if (exists) {
      fs.readFile(absPath, function(err, data) {
        if (err) {
          send404(response)
        } else {
          sendPage(response, absPath, data);
        }
      });
    } else {
      send404(response);
    }
  });
}
```

9. And now it's time to create the HTTP server:
```
var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  var filePath = false;

  if (request.url == '/') {
    filePath = "public/index.html";
  } else {
    filePath = "public" + request.url;
  }

  var absPath = "./" + filePath;
  serverWorking(response, absPath);
});

```


10. Now we need to start our server. And here's the tricky part. Do you remember how we told the server to listen to the 3000th port in our first example? No? I'll remind you:

`http.createServer(<some code here>).listen(3000)`

11. We can do it when we run our server locally. But Heroku sets a dynamically assigned port number to your app. That's why we need to handle all this mess with ports as itâ€™s shown below:

`var port_number = server.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000); `
