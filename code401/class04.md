# Readings: Data Modeling

# Q1 Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
* Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
* You receive fast feedback.
* TDD creates a detailed specification.
* TDD reduces time spent on rework.
* You spend less time in the debugger.
* You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.
* TDD tells you whether your last change (or refactoring) broke previously working code.
* TDD allows the design to evolve and adapt to your changing understanding of the problem.
* TDD forces the radical simplification of the code. You will only write code in response to the * requirements of the tests.
* You're forced to write small classes focused on one thing.
* TDD creates SOLID code.
* TDD supports a clean interface.
* TDD creates code that is maintainable, flexible, and easily extensible.
* The resulting unit tests are simple and act as documentation for the code. Since TDD use cases are written as tests, other programmers can view the tests as usage examples of how the code is intended to work.
* The development time to market is shorter.
* The programmer’s productivity is increased.
* Development costs are cut.
* Quality is improved.
* Bugs are reduced.
* TDD gives programmers the confidence to change the larger architecture of an application when adding new functionalities. Without the flexibility of TDD, developers frequently add new functionality by virtually bolting it to the existing application without true integration, which can cause problems down the road.


# Q2 In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
when there are  methods need to be run before the test and  methods run after it.


# Q3 What is one downside of Test Driven Development
* slow
* if the code update its need update



 # Q4 What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

  Classes inherit from classes and create subclass 

# Q5 Why REST?
REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
REST Makes your Application More Scalable
Caching is Easier with REST
REST is Flexibile

* functional programming
  Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. 
  Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.
* object-oriented programming (OOP)
  object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.
  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
* class
  emplates for creating objects. The constructor() method is used for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
* super
 a keyword is used to access and call functions on an object’s parent.
* this
  refers to the current object himself

* Test Driven Development (TDD)
  Test-driven development is a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously. In Software Engineering, It is sometimes known as "Test First Development." TDD includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior of the code.
* Jest
  Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase built by facebook team

* Continuous Integration (CI)
  Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

* REST
  Representational state transfer (REST)
  is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful
* Data Model
  is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
