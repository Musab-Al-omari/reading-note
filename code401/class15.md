##### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
1. A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
2. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
3. The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb). The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
4. The action receives the request and passes it on to the view.
5. The view renders the page as HTML.
6. The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.
