### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
these are the steps that i learnt that will help me to think like a programmer 
#### first Understand 

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
Do you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn’t see before?
Most programmers know this feeling.

#### second Plan\
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
To get a good plan, answer this question:
“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!


#### third Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).
#### forth Stuck?
By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”

First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

i like this qoute “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”

### What the heck is the event loop anyway? | Philip Roberts | JSConf EU 
i will give an example 

when i was a chiled i use  to go to the AlAmeer Hassan hospital  so at the 7:00 o'clock the dentist Clinic would open 
so every one go in the queue  but if some one have Tooth extraction it will go to another queue that will start when ever the first queue finished the second queue will be based on  the situation  the less time your situation  needs it will determine your position in the line .
