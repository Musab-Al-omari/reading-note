# Csharp

### Csharp is an elegant object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework.

### The .NET Framework consists of
 1. the Common Language Runtime (CLR) 
 2. the .NET Framework class library.

**variable declared by specifying the name and data type.**

1. an contain letters, numbers and the underscore character (_)
2.  must start with a letter or underscore.

#### note :-A line of code that completes an action is called a statement. Each statement in C# must end with a semicolon.
 

#### we can define a variable with data type integer by using `int myAge=5`

#### There are a number of built-in data types in C#. The most common are:
**int**- integer. `int ​x = 42;`
**float** - floating point number.` data type can store fractional numbers  `
**double** - double-precision version of float.`double ​pi = 3.14`
**char** - a single character.`char y = 'Z'`
**bool** - Boolean that can have only one of two values: True or False.`bool ​isOnline = true;`
**string** - a sequence of characters.`string ​firstName = "David";`

#### note Note that char values are assigned using single quotes and string values require double quotes.

#### Use float or double?
The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only **six or seven decimal digits**, while double variables have a precision of about **15 digits.** Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.
